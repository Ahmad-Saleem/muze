# Visual Group

Visual Group renders a group for Muze which is the renderer for the Fusion Line of Product Ecosystem. This has an abastract Grammar of Graphics (GoG) implemented. However its much more than the semantics of GoG. It has understanding of data visualizaion as well. It comes with a systematic hierarchy of logical division of a visualization's composition with hackability in every level of the hierarchy.
